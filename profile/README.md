## Hi there 👋
🙋‍♀️ We're FrauDetector - we are creating an open source project to help prevent fraudulent purchases on your platform!<br />
📅 Some of our plans are listed below
- Integration with platforms such as WHMCS and Blesta
- A public API to allow for users to integrate our database into their own billing solutions
- Machine Learning Integration for more accurate fraud prevention
- Crowdsourced Fraud Reports
- Funding to help support large contributors and the upkeep of our infrastructure.

## #stopfraud
We ask that if you use our project you make a post with #stopfraud to help spread awareness and link people to our github organisation as we will be writing documents on how to stay safe from fraud online! <br />
Our whole goal with this project, is not only to help prevent fraud, but it is also to help spread awareness of the different types of fraud that are committed online and how they may affect you, or how you may be targeted by fraudsters.
