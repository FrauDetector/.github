## Hi there 👋
🙋‍♀️ We're fraud prevention database - we are creating an open source project to help prevent fraudulent purchases on your platform!
📅 Some of our plans are listed below
- Integration with platforms such as WHMCS and Blesta
- A public API to allow for users to integrate our database into their own billing solutions
- More to come

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
